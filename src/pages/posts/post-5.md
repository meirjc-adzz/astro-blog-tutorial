In this tutorial, we'll walk you through setting up your first Astro project and provide you with a solid foundation for future web development projects.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 14.15.1 or later)
- A package manager like npm or Yarn

## Step 1: Create a New Astro Project

First, open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Astro project:

```bash
npm create astro my-astro-project
```

Replace my-astro-project with your desired project name.

## Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Next, navigate to your newly created project directory:

```bash
cd my-astro-project
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Now, install the necessary dependencies for your Astro project:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now view your Astro project in the browser at http://localhost:3000.

> Congratulations! You've successfully set up your first Astro project. You can now start building and customizing your project to suit your needs.
